The IMI Max patches is a series of Max patches for the students in design for interaction and moving image at the London College of Communication (University of the Arts London). 

This version comes without the media and the plugins folder. To install or update your plugins use the plugins_download patch in the Max Extra menu.

If you have been a student on the course and have the the media and the plugins folder installed, the installer will update your patches but won't touch the media / plugins folder.
